# heroclix-roll20-assets
A collection of assets for playing on Roll20 during this time when we can't play in person

These are all assets using a template designed by Cory of the Eaglecast, with some contributions from Bryan. We are working to have everything post July rotation available and may backfill as we go for Bronze/Silver age events.
